# Healthy_Oral_Microbiome


This repository contains all of the code used to analyze results found in Nearing et al., 2020 "Assesing the variation within the oral microbiome of healthy adults". The R folder contains all of the custom functions that were created and the vignettes folder contains markdown files containing all of the code used for analysis. Unfortanely the associated data to run this code is not included within this repository. To gain access to the data along with the fully working R package please contact the Atlantic Partnership for Tomorrow's Health Project (http://www.atlanticpath.ca/)
